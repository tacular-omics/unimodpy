# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] (2026-09-23)

### Added

- `write_tsv` and `write_obo` writers; the OBO header round-trips, and entries keep `definition_ref` and `header_lines`.
- Online UNIMOD browser (GitHub Pages) with search, sort, filter and a full detail view.
- FastAPI REST API and MCP server (`server` extra), deployable to Vercel, which also serves the browser dashboard at the root.

### Changed

- **Breaking for the `server` extra:** the MCP server was ported from FastMCP (mcp 1.x) to `MCPServer` (mcp 2.x); it now requires mcp 2.
- MCP tools return typed responses (`structuredContent` with an `outputSchema`).
- Releases publish to PyPI by trusted publishing; the version lives only in `unimodpy.__version__`, with `CITATION.cff` kept in sync.

### Fixed

- The dashboard HTML is read as UTF-8, so it loads on Windows.
- The MCP session manager is created per request, fixing session reuse errors on Vercel.
